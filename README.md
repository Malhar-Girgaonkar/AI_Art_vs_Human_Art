hello this is my first complete machine learning model made to predict a binary classification.<br/>
this project classifies a provided images as either of following two categories:<br/>
-->AI generated portrait art [index = 0]<br/>
-->Human made art [index = 1]<br/>
<br/>
I have use Tensorflow,OpenCV,Matplotlib,Numpy,etc to create an CNN<br/>
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has multiple layers as Conv2D,MaxPooling2D,Dense,Flatten,etc with various activation functions.<br/>
This neural network predicts probability of an image being in gievn two classes and print the majority proobability as image class <br/>
